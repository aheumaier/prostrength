# This model initially had no columns defined. If you add columns to the
# model remove the "{}" from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below

one: { username: "coach", role: "coach", email: "coach@myhome.de", encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, '12345') %> }
# column: value
#
two: { username: "user1", email: "user1@myhome.de", encrypted_password: <%= User.new.send(:password_digest, '12345') %> }
